# Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction

# Abstract

In this Modern Era, Smartphones are an integral part of the lives of human beings. When a smartphone is purchased ,many factors like the Display, Processor, Memory, Camera, Thickness, Battery, Connectivity and others are taken into account. One of the major factor which also people look is whether the phone they are buying is worth the cost. In the competitive mobile phone market companies want to understand sales data of mobile phones and factors which drive the prices. This project looks to solve the problem by taking the historical data pertaining to the key
features of smartphones along with its cost and develop a model that will predict the approximate price of
the new smartphone with a reasonable accuracy. The dataset used for this purpose has taken into consideration 21 different parameters for predicting the price of the phone. Random Forest Classifier,
Logistic Regression, Decision tree and KNN have been used primarily. Based on the accuracy, the
appropriate algorithm has been used to predict the prices of the smartphone. This not only helps the
customers decide the right phone to purchase, it also helps the owners decide what should be the appropriate
pricing of the phone for the features that they offer.

# Problem statement

In this project, we are going to explore and analyze a dataset which contains specifications of two thousand mobile phones and try to predict optimum price ranges for a list of mobile phones in the market by applying various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest and k-nearest neighbours(KNN).
